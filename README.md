Project 

To build a linear regression model to predict the house sale prices and evaluate models according to MAE (median absolute error) on houses with sale prices between the 5th and 95th percentiles.

Data  acquisition

The King County Assessor releases all of its data on housing stock, assessed values, and sale prices. We downloaded real property sales data (https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Real%20Property%20Sales.zip ) and residential property data (https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Residential%20Building_tab.zip).
